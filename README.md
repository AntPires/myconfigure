myconfigure
===========

This repo is my emacs (mostly) config repo, 
the basic idea is when I have a new ubuntu / Mac machine, 
I can setup the development environment with just a script,
also keep multi dev box in same shape.

## emacs

which is is the (dot)emacs file.

## install.sh

which is the install script. it should be a Makefile, but just keep it simple.

## font 
which store some programming font.
